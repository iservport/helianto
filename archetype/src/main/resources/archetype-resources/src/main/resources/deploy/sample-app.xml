			Pre-configured service bean	
			
			Transactional service bean required (recommended) if you 
			want to extend the service layer with new functionality.
			
			Change the bean name (preConfiguredMgr) and the inner
			target bean name (preConfiguredMgrTarget) to best fit 
			your needs. Of course, you will have to implement
			org.helianto.your.package.YourServiceMgrImpl or a 
			class with the appropriate name to be proxied and 
			participate	in transactions.
			
			One or more properties may be required, as "someDao".
			Don't forget to implement and declare them here. Remember
			that they will be injected into the target bean that,
			in turn, must expose an appropriate setter for each
			property.
