Welcome to The Helianto Project Core Module

  Helianto project is designed to provide easy "construction blocks" to an Hibernate+Spring+Acegi based application.

* Overview

  Helianto core module, in contrast with other modules, exposes both basic domain and service classes.
  It is also the base for conventions that affect the other modules as well.
