		<section name="Welcome to the Helianto Project">
			
			<p>Helianto project is designed to provide easy "construction
				blocks" to an Hibernate+Spring+Acegi based application.
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Project Goals">
				<p>Project goals are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>encourage the use of dependency injection and object
						relational mapping,
					</li>
					<li>shorten development time necessary to wire up usual
						persistence and service beans, like data sources,
						daos, transaction management,
						internationalization,
					</li>
					<li>provide common extensible domain structure and
						services to meet the requirements of applications
						that may share user authentication and authorization
						across different organizations, as well as customer
						and supplier relationship management, production
						process structure and more,
					</li>
					<li>make integration tests easier, and
					</li>
					<li>provide a minimal web application template with
						secure access presentation layer included.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Goals are consistent with the mission statement (see the
					reference guide).
				</p>
				
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="Creating New Projects Based on Helianto">
				
				<p>Projects extending Helianto may:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>copy the template to start a new application and
						include the appropriate Helianto sub-project
						packages in the classpath,
					</li>
					<li>create or extend domain or service beans to implement
						the desired functionality,
					</li>
					<li>write additional O/R mappings and context definition
						required by the new domain or service beans,
					</li>
					<li>run unit and integration tests,
					</li>
					<li>write the presentation layer using a MVC framework of
						choice, as Struts, JSF, Spring or Spring Web Flow,
					</li>
					<li>if using Spring Web Flow, add provided credential and
						access flows as plugins,
					</li>
					<li>run additional tests, and
					</li>
					<li>deploy the application to a servlet container.
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Although Helianto imposes no restriction to the
					presentation layer, use of Freemarker and Sitemesh is
					encouraged.
				</p>

				<p>Helianto project is currently "work in progress".
