<h2>The namespace operator identification.</h2>
<p>The operator controlling the current namespace is named 
<b>${operator.operatorName}.</b>
</p>
<h3>You can also use this application as an entry point to explore and learn how to
develop your own. Add value, starting from Helianto artifacts!</h3>
<p>For example, it is possible to create and expose more than one operator or
namespace and select them to filter entities, although this is out of the scope of this
application. If you are a programmer, a good start would be to uncomment certain parts
of this source code and modify them to show a target list placed in memory
just for demostration purposes.</p>

<!-- here is the code to uncomment and modify

<#list operatorList?if_exists as operator>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>${operator.id}</td>
	<td>${operator.operatorName?if_exists}</td>
</tr>
</#list>
</table>

-->
<#--
 IMPORTANT:
 To add or modify operators, add the appropriate anchors to the list pointing
 to valid transitions on the corresponding flow.
