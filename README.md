The Helianto Project
======

v. 1.0.x
---
Form previous versions (not backwards compatible with 1.0+), please, see [https://sourceforge.net/projects/helianto/?source=directory](https://sourceforge.net/projects/helianto/?source=directory).

The Helianto Project provides an open source API with extension points to help jvm developers to easily 
create a working project. Its layered architecture readily provides common domain objects wired to be 
persisted via ORM to many popular databases.

Helianto relies on the Spring Framework to implement many of its features. As a result, the API 
is highly customizable, mostly just by changing configuration. Some of the available modules are:

Helianto-core: core configuration and basic domain model containing business isolation and users abstraction.

Helianto-partner: extends helianto-core domain and service to provide flexible relationship with external 
business parties.

Helianto-document: extends helianto-partner domain and service to introduce document handling. Documents are a core 
abstraction to Helianto, extended by other modules to represent financial records, parts, processes and other.
