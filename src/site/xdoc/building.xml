	<section name="What is Maven">
		
		<p>To build a Java application, the usual choices are
			<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant
			</a> or
			<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven
			</a>. The latter provides a rich set of plugins ready to perform
			various tasks. Some of them are explained in short in this document.
		</p>
		
		<subsection name="Install Maven">
			<p>Download and install Maven 1.0.2 or greater. Maven will ease the
				download of dependencies and source code from cvs, build and
				install packages.
			</p>
			<p>Maven runs from the command line, but there is an Eclipse plugin to
				help running plugins from this IDE. See
				<a
					href="http://mevenide.codehaus.org/mevenide-ui-eclipse/update/index.html">
					Mevenide
				</a> for details.
